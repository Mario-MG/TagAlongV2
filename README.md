# TagAlong
 
If you're anything like me and tend to keep your playlists neatly organised according to genre, year, and basically any kind of distinction you can come up with (e.g. duets, covers, acoustic, etc.), maybe you've realised that doing this in Spotify can be somewhat cumbersome.

I decided to create this app to make it easier and simpler. It lets you access your Spotify playlists and tag the tracks with whatever keywords you like. Later, you can use the tags to create new playlists.

For example, maybe you have a playlist with a lot of rock and pop of different decades. Then you decide you want a playlist just with 80s rock. So you just have to select the tags "rock" and "80s"... Et voil√†, there's your new playlist! There's even an auto-update feature, so any new tracks that you tag with those keywords will be automatically added too.

Since it is still in development, I must explicitly register any potential user in the Spotify Developer Dashboard, so it's not open to the public. If you are interested in seeing it work in its current state, feel free to contact me at mmaringomez.mmg@gmail.com.
